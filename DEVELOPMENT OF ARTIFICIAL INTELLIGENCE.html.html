<h1>Development of artificial  intelligence</h1>
<p>In 1956 American social scientist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon and American physicist and computer scientist Allan Newell at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania devised a program called Logic Theorist that simulated human thinking on computers. The first AI conference occurred at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire in 1956. This conference inspired researchers to undertake projects that emulated human behavior in the areas of reasoning, language comprehension, and communications. In addition to Newell and Simon, computer scientists and mathematicians Claude Shannon, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy laid the groundwork for creating "thinking" machines from computers.
The search for AI has taken two major directions: psychological and physiological research into the nature of human thought, and the technological development of increasingly sophisticated computing systems. Some AI developers are primarily interested in learning more about the workings of the human brain and thus attempt to mimic its methods and processes. Other developers are more interested in making computers perform a specific task, which may involve computing methods well beyond the capabilities of the human brain. Contemporary fields of interest resulting from early AI research include expert systems, cellular automata (treating pieces of data like biological cells), and artificial life (see Automata Theory). The search for AI goes well beyond computer science and involves cross-disciplinary studies in such areas as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, information theory, and mechanical engineering, among many others. The search for AI has led to advancements in those fields, as well.
