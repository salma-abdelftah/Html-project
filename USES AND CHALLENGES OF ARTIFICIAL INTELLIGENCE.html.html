<h1>USES AND CHALLENGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSGz_G2L7qfGf2GBi487qHTmbQs3aT1_BTFvF05oBtYeBKf4amO&usqp=CAU" alt="Artificial Intelligence">
<p>AI programs have a broad array of applications. They are used by financial institutions, scientists, psychologists, medical practitioners, design engineers, planning authorities, and security services, to name just a few.
 AI techniques are also applied in systems used to browse the Internet.
 AI programs tend to be highly specialized for a specific task.
 They can play games, predict stock values, interpret photographs, diagnose diseases, plan travel itineraries, translate languages, take dictation, draw analogies, help design complex machinery, teach logic, make jokes, compose music, create drawings, and learn to do tasks better.
 AI programs perform some of these tasks well.
 In a famous example, a supercomputer called Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
 In developing its strategy, Deep Blue utilized parallel processing (interlinked and concurrent computer operations) to process 200 million chess moves per second.
 AI programs are often better than people at predicting stock prices, and they can create successful long-term business plans.
 AI programs are used in electronic commerce to detect possible fraud, using complex learning algorithms, and are relied upon to authorize billions of financial transactions daily.
 AI programs can also mimic creative human behavior.
 For example, AI-generated music can sound like compositions by famous composers. Some of the most widely used AI applications involve information processing and pattern recognition.
 For example, one AI method now widely used is "data mining," which can find interesting patterns in extremely large databases.
 Data mining is an application of machine learning, in which specialized algorithms enable computers to "learn." Other applications include information filtering systems that discover user interests in an online environment.
 However, it remains unknown whether computer programs could ever learn to solve problems on their own, rather than simply following what they are programmed to do.</p>
